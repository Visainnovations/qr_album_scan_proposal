### 5.3 Why ₹1,00,000 is Not Feasible

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Development Hours** | ~400 hours minimum for this scope |
| **At ₹1,00,000** | Works out to ₹250/hour |
| **Market Junior Rate** | ₹400-₹1,200/hour |
| **Conclusion** | ₹1L is **below even junior freelancer rates** |

**Simple Math:**
- 400 hours ÷ ₹1,00,000 = **₹250/hour**
- This is **lower than minimum freelance rates in India**
- Even fresh graduates charge ₹400-500/hour
